# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game
Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors. The outcomes are determined by the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. It's often used to make quick, random decisions.
